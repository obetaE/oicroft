  /* 
  AN EXPLANATION OF ALL THAT'S HERE EXCEPT THE OBVIOUS ONES
  Key Adjustments:
Prices Array:

Each entry includes unit and price, allowing the admin to define as many units and their prices as needed (e.g., "25L, $20", "50L, $40").
Flexible for all unit types: liters, kg, big, small, etc.
Product ID:

Defaults to an auto-generated value but can be manually set if needed.
No need to overcomplicate unless there's a specific reason for manual IDs.
Counter Field:

Optional. Holds minQuantity and pricePerUnit for counter-based products.
Provides a baseline for calculations outside the schema.
Discounts:

regularDiscount for static discounts set by the admin.
promoCodes as an array of promo codes and their discount values.
Totals and Order Tracking:

This doesnâ€™t belong in the product schema. Instead:
Orders Schema: Create a separate schema to log orders, quantities, and timestamps.
This decouples product definition from transactional data, simplifying maintenance and reporting.
