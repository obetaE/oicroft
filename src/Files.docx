The `process.env` object is a built-in feature of Node.js that allows you to access environment variables in your application. These are key-value pairs stored outside your application code, often used to store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or email credentials.

### What are `process.env.EMAIL_USER` and `process.env.EMAIL_PASS`?
They are environment variables that:
1. `EMAIL_USER`: Stores the email address or username of the email account you'll use to send emails.
2. `EMAIL_PASS`: Stores the password or application-specific password (if required) for the email account.

### How to Set These Up?

#### 1. **Using a `.env` File**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
   - Add your credentials to the file:
     ```plaintext
     EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
     EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
     ```
   - **Important**: Never commit `.env` files to version control (e.g., GitHub) because they contain sensitive information. Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude it.

#### 2. **Accessing in Your Code**
   - Install the `dotenv` package to load the `.env` variables into `process.env`.
     ```bash
     npm install dotenv
     ```
   - Load the `.env` file at the beginning of your project (e.g., in `next.config.js` or the main entry point):
     ```javascript
     require('dotenv').config();
     ```

#### 3. **Secure Your Credentials**
   - For production, store these variables securely in the environment configuration of your hosting platform:
     - **Vercel**: Add `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` in the "Environment Variables" section of your Vercel dashboard.
     - **Heroku**: Use the `heroku config:set` command:
       ```bash
       heroku config:set EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
       ```

### Example `.env` File
```plaintext
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-secure-password
```

### Why Use Environment Variables?
- **Security**: Keeps sensitive information out of your source code.
- **Flexibility**: Makes it easy to change credentials without modifying your code.
- **Portability**: Allows different configurations for development, staging, and production environments.
